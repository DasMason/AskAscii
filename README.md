This code was written by yours truly :) but I got some help from my dad and some youtube explanations on how ascii works.

This is the original project output without color or being in its own PNG file:

As you can see its not that easy to see the picture.

This is the output after adding a function to make a png and add color:

As you can see in the photo, it is a lot better looking. 

Description:

This is a project created from the idea that my Dad gave me. He made a program in the past that took a photo and turned it into an ascii image. The project was called "Hotel Crawler" Here is the link:

How To Use:

To use this code you need some prerequisites first:
-Python installed
-Pillow installed
-vscode installed

And that's it! First, download the program from the repo and import it to vscode after installing pillow and python. Then you should be able to click the run button to start with the base photos, or you can upload your own file(s) to use! To do this, find the location that you installed the folder with the photos and the program. Then, move your downloaded photos to the Photos folder (Delete the others if you want). Finally you should be able to just click Run it will work!
